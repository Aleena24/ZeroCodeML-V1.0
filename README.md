# ZeroCodeML-V1.0

We are a team of postgraduate students from the M.Sc. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning program at CHRIST (Deemed to be University), Bangalore. We proudly present ZeroCodeML, an intuitive no-code machine learning (ML) platform designed to streamline the ML workflow for users with little to no programming experience. Our platform enables users to seamlessly upload datasets, perform automated exploratory data analysis (EDA), preprocess data, and generate valuable insights, predictions, and visualizations with ease.

Driven by a commitment to harnessing advanced AI and machine learning techniques, we recognized the need for a powerful yet user-friendly solution to simplify complex ML processes. ZeroCodeML empowers users with an efficient and intuitive platform for end-to-end machine learning model development and data analysis, eliminating the technical barriers typically associated with ML implementation.

This is Version 1.0 of ZeroCodeML, and we are continuously working to enhance its capabilities. Future versions will introduce expanded functionalities, improved performance, and a more refined user experience. We are committed to evolving this platform into a comprehensive ML solution that caters to a wide range of users, from beginners to experienced professionals.

We appreciate your support and interest in our project and remain dedicated to advancing the field of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning through innovative research and development. Stay tuned for upcoming updates and enhancements!
